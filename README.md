# Weapon-generator
1. make class oriented weapons
2. make more effects
3. assign weapon lists to classes
5. get player inputs
6. make subclasses
7. make main function that prints all in a formatted form

completed 1-5 as well as 7 this was a time sensitive project and subclasses would take too long
